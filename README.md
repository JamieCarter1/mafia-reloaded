#MAFIA reloaded

Mafia is a common game played by people when they are bored and in large groups. Mostly, things are done by choosing a "God" and then closing your eyes when "God" says so. This often leads to semi-open eyes and so on. This is designed to complement the actual game and remove the need for a "God" in the game.

###Usage Instructions
You need `python3` installed, and an _up to date_ web browser. There is no other direct dependancy.
On separate terminals, invoke the following commands:

```shell
$cd (directory of code)
$python3 -m http.server 8888
```

and

```shell
$cd (directory of code)
$python3 -m mafia_game.py
```
After this, open 6 tabs and navigate to http://localhost:8888/ on each one.
The in game instructions should be easy to follow after this given that you have played the game before.
