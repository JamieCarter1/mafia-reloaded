    <h3>Basic Game Rules</h3>
    <p>Objectives: Citizens/detectives need to weed out all of the mafia, while the mafia attempt to kill all the citizens/detectives. </p>
    <h4>How to Play</h4>
    <ol>There are several rounds to this game, I've listed them below:
      <li>The MAFIA vote - only the MAFIA can take part in this vote. They decide whom they want to kill.</li>
      <li>The Detective vote - The detectives can choose to find out the true identity of one person using this vote. But beware, there's nothing to stop non-detectives from speaking up in the discussion round claiming that they're detectives too.</li>
      <li>The Anonymous Vote - The name of the person killed is revealed, and everyone votes silently for this round</li>
      <li>The Discussion Round - The names of the two highest voted is revealed, and it's an open forum for discussion. Players can emphasize their own innocence or condemn others.</li>
      <li>The Open Vote - Again, you vote. But others can see what who you're voting for</li>
      </ol>
